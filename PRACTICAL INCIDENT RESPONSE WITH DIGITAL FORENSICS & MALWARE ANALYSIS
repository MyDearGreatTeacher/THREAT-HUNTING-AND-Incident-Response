PRACTICAL INCIDENT RESPONSE WITH DIGITAL FORENSICS & MALWARE ANALYSIS

https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/training/schedule/#practical-incident-response-with-digital-forensics--malware-analysis-9569

Digital forensics and incident response are indispensable techniques to protect organizations from attacks. Furthermore, in recent years, many malware related attacks have occurred in enterprise environments, so you need deep knowledge and analysis techniques for malware and attack tools used via the malware as well. For example, a RAT has a file uploading function to an infected host. When a file is uploaded, the malware creates a temporary file which the name ends with ".tmp" extension with the original name. If you determine this by malware analysis, you can discover the file which the attackers sent by analyzing the NTFS journal file. This is why we believe malware analysis is needed.

In this course, we provide a virtual enterprise environment for investigation and targeted attack scenarios against that environment, in order to learn all these techniques. The attack scenario is based on actual incidents. For example, attackers exploit a client PC and downloads RAT malware. Then the attackers gain administrator rights and execute Mimikatz to get higher credentials and to generate the "Golden Ticket" moving laterally. Finally, they steal victim's confidential documents. Hence, attendees can achieve the same result as solving actual cases through our scenario. We also provide additional artifacts applied in some attacks which are not included within our scenario. This learning will give attendees the experience and knowledge necessary for solving many cases.

Our training course offers the latest supported windows versions (Windows 7/8.1/10, Server 2012 R2/2016) as HDD/memory images for investigation. We also provide a pre-built analysis VM, outputs of analysis tools and IDC/IDAPython script templates for IDA Pro so that participants can learn a lot of things efficiently without setting up analysis tools or waiting until the completion of tools execution. This allows participants to experience more than 100 artifacts and exercises. You will have almost the same knowledge as the instructors' one by the end of this course.
